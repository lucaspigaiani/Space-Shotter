## Singleton, Observer, Factory Method
Description:
This project focuses on foundational design patterns essential for managing global resources, handling events, and creating families of related objects.

### Singleton Pattern
Ensures a single instance of a class, providing a global point of access. Ideal for managing global resources like a game manager.

### Observer Pattern
Enables a one-to-many relationship between objects, allowing changes in one object to notify and update its dependents. Useful for handling events and notifications.

### Factory Method Pattern
Defines an interface for creating objects but delegates the choice of its type to its subclasses. This pattern is valuable for creating families of related or dependent objects.
